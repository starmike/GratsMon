# GratsMon

This is an addon to simply be friendly to people while running dungeons at full speed.

The addon only works in dungeons.
There's currently no way to add custom grats strings, but I will do that soon.

The addon simply congratulates someone for dingning while in a dungeon. Groups move so fast now that it's difficult sometimes to type "grats" without lagging bedind a bit.

## Console commands
/gratsmon on

/gratsmon off
